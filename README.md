# UFOs
## Project Overview
This project focuses on sharing UFO information through a dynamic webpage. The original table has all the compiled data and the user can then filter that data on a number of criteria using the filter blocks.
## Results
The webpage is clean, engaging, and most importantly, easy to use. Following a brief description of the page's purpose, the user is presented with a table containing the full dataset and a series of filter options. By entering options in any or all of the search filters, the user will be presented with an updated table showing only the sightings that match the entered search criteria. <br>![Search Screenshot](/static/images/ScreenShot.png)
## Summary
While the basic structure of the webpage is good, one drawback is the rigidity of the search filters. The location information in the table data is all lowercase, and must be entered accordingly in the search filters to populate the updated table. Most people tend to capitalize city, state and country, so adjusting the filter to match text, regardless of case, would be a good update.<br> Additionally, since there are so many potential variations for shape (i.e. circle, circular, round), a dropdown menu for the shape search criteria is probably a better option than text entry.
